I have several collections of various electronic devices - few ones that I bought because they were "cool" (or cheap), but mostly ones that I saved from otherwise being thrown to e-waste.

Categorizing every single type of devices would be nearly impossible (without adding pages for just a single item), so I've worked out a few main categories:

- Laptops (TBD) - portable PCs with the x86 architecture.
- [Smartphones](/collections/smartphones.html) - "modern" touchscreen phones, with cellular connectivity; also some PDAs.
- Tablets (TBD) - mobile devices with larger touchscreens, usually without 2G/3G/4G modems.
- [Phones](/collections/phones.html) - older generation cell phones, usually with a physical keyboard and no touchscreen.
- Computers (TBD) - classic desktops, without a built-in monitor/keyboard/etc; also some PC parts/expansion cards.

A couple of notes about the "scoring system": devices in some categories have their visual condition and working state assessed on a 1-5 scale:

- **1/5** (Terrible) - device is not powering up, has a cracked screen/touch panel, missing critical parts, or is otherwise unusable, no matter the visual condition.
- **2/5** (Bad) - severe cracks on the screen glass or enclosure, severe usage marks and scratches, damages to the structural integrity, device otherwise unpleasant to look at or use.
- **3/5** (Fair) - minor cracks on the screen or the enclosure, non-critical parts missing/broken, above normal usage marks and scratches.
- **4/5** (Good) - normal usage marks with no missing/broken parts or features, device fully functional.
- **5/5** (Perfect) - near-new visual condition, fully functional device, well-preserved with barely noticeable usage marks.
